# Reco7 Basic Concept


> Left/Right Recognition Program: A Recognise app built with React Native.

It Help Treat Chronic Pain. Used as part of a Graded Motor Imagery programme to improve performance and assist with rehabilitation in a range of complex pain, and injury states. 

ReCO 7 Experience is a Left/Right Recognition Test. The focus of this app is the discrimination of hand and feet’s side between right and left. This is the first stage of the GMI (Graded Motor Imagery) to treat patients with CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome) or patients with body image pain.

The biggest differential of this app is inclusion of “drawn hands “ and “drawn feet”. This app has three levels of difficulty, that will randomly increase the images.

The aim of this exercise is to improve the brain’s capacity to recognise the affect body extremity.

This app was developed under a supervision of specialized healthcare team from Québec, Canada, who has more than 20 years treating CRPS patients. For further information and treatment of CRPS, please, contact your healthcare provider.
